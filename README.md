# Expecta custom matchers example

This repo has some sample code to show the usage of the [Expecta](https://github.com/specta/expecta) testing library, and how to write custom matchers for it.

It's a companion to two posts on [mokacoding](http://mokacoding.com):

* [Expecta, a matcher library that speaks english](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/expecta/)
* [How to write an Expecta custom matcher](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/expecta-custom-matchers/)
